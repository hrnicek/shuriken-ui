# Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adaptive layouts.

## Available sizes

Each breakpoint matches a fixed screen width. Values are min-width based and apply when the screen width is equal or greater.

## Composition
You can use the different breakpoint classes in conjunction with Tailwind's special orientation classes (`portrait` and `landscape`) to create complex responsive layouts. You can chain instructions in the following way:


::code-group

```vue [Nuxt]
<template>
  <div 
    class="bg-indigo-500 md:portrait:bg-yellow-400 md:landscape:bg-green-500 size-4"
  />
</template>
```
::

## Customization

You can customize the breakpoints by adding a `--breakpoint-*` variable to the `@theme` directive of your `main.css` file. Only include the breakpoints you want to override in your configuration or completely new ones:

::code-group

```css [main.css]
@theme {
  /* Don't include this unless you change it */
  --breakpoint-sm: 640px;
  --breakpoint-md: 768px;
  --breakpoint-lg: 1024px;
  --breakpoint-xl: 1280px;
  --breakpoint-2xl: 1536px;

  /* Add your custom breakpoints here */
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
}
```
