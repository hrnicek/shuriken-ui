# Migrating to v4
Learn how to migrate your project to Shuriken UI v4.

## Overview
Shuriken UI v4 introduces a new set of features and improvements. This guide will help you migrate your project to the latest version.

As we were making updates to the library, we noticed that the Tailwind CSS team was releasing the first alpha of its highly anticipated v4. We decided to align our release with Tailwind CSS v4 beta to take advantage of the new features and improvements, that are quite outstanding.

## Less JS, more CSS

With the current Tailwind v3 version, the `tailwind.config.js` file allows you to override Tailwind’s default design tokens. It’s a customization hub where you can add custom utility classes and themes, disable plugins, and more.

In Tailwind v4, you don’t need a `tailwind.config.js` file and `@tailwind` directives. You’ll only need to import tailwindcss into your main CSS file, and you’re good to go. We decided to follow the same approach in Shuriken UI v4 to integrate seamlessly with the new Tailwind CSS paradigm. Therefore, loading Tailwind CSS and Shuriken UI is now as easy as:

::code-group
  ```css [main.css]
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@shuriken-ui/tailwind';
  ```
::

## Dark mode
The dark mode is now also declared using your main CSS file. You can enable it by using the `@variant` directive and by adding the following line to your main CSS file:

::code-group
  ```css [main.css]
  @variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
  ```
::

## Theme directive
The theme directive is now also declared using your main CSS file. You can enable it by using the `@theme` directive in your main CSS file. The theme directive is used to define the fonts, the color palette, the animations and anything related to the styles of your application. You can define the colors of your theme using the `@theme` directive in your main CSS file:

::code-group{expandable}
  ```css [main.css]
  @theme {
    --font-sans: Inter, sans-serif;
    --font-monospace: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace;

    --color-primary-50: var(--color-purple-50);
    --color-primary-100: var(--color-purple-100);
    --color-primary-200: var(--color-purple-200);
    --color-primary-300: var(--color-purple-300);
    --color-primary-400: var(--color-purple-400);
    --color-primary-500: var(--color-purple-500);
    --color-primary-600: var(--color-purple-600);
    --color-primary-700: var(--color-purple-700);
    --color-primary-800: var(--color-purple-800);
    --color-primary-900: var(--color-purple-900);
    --color-primary-950: var(--color-purple-950);

    --animate-nui-placeload: nui-placeload 1s linear infinite forwards;

    @keyframes nui-placeload {
      0% {
        background-position: -468px 0;
      }
      100% {
        background-position: 468px 0;
      }
    }
  }
  ```
::

::info-block{icon='logos:tailwindcss-icon'}
With this new CSS variables approach, Tailwind v4 is able to infer color classes if your variables start with the `--color-*` prefix. If you create a `--color-custom` variable, Tailwind will automatically generate classes like `bg-custom` or `text-custom`.
