# Design Principles

Let's talk about the design principles of Shuriken UI.

## Exhaustivity

Shuriken UI components are thought to be exhaustive in terms of functionality, covering a broad spectrum of potential use cases and scenarios. An exhaustive UI library anticipates the diverse needs of developers and designers, providing a comprehensive set of components that can be easily customized to meet specific requirements.

Shuriken UI is an exhaustive UI library, meaning that it is a powerful resource that minimizes the need for custom, one-off solutions, promoting a more standardized and efficient development process, when using its components.

Additionally, it empowers designers and developers to focus on creativity and innovation rather than spending excessive time reinventing the wheel, ultimately leading to more robust and feature-rich digital interfaces.

## Consistency

Consistency is the most important thing in design. It is the key to a good user experience. It is the difference between a good design and a bad design. It is the difference between a good product and a bad product.

In Shuriken UI, we made sure that components remain consistent when used together. For example, all components share common properties, like `border-radius`, `sizes`, and `colors`. This makes it easy to use them together, by creating a coherent design system.

## Branding

Branding is important. It is the first thing that people see when they visit your website or your app. Shuriken UI provides an easy way of branding your application by setting a few CSS variables. One of them is the `primary` color variable, which is used to reflect the main theme color on all components.

Shuriken UI also gives you the ability to control the main gray shade of your application by using the `muted` color abstraction. This will help you to create a consistent look and feel across your application. This is especially useful when you want to create a dark theme for your application.

For more details about branding your application, check out the [colors section](/docs/theming/colors) of the documentation.

## Accessibility

Accessibility in a UI (User Interface) library is of paramount importance as it ensures that digital products are usable by a diverse range of individuals, including those with disabilities. An accessible UI library goes beyond mere aesthetics and functionality, striving to create an inclusive user experience for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.

Prioritizing accessibility in a UI library is not just a design choice; it is a commitment to fostering digital environments that prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusivity.

## Reusability

Designing UI library components with reusability in mind is essential for creating efficient and maintainable user interfaces. When components are crafted with a modular and flexible approach, they become building blocks that can be easily adapted and reused across different parts of an application or even in entirely separate projects.

By fostering a mindset of reusability during the design and implementation of Shuriken UI, we made sure that developers can create a foundation that not only streamlines development workflows but also contributes to a more cohesive and user-friendly digital ecosystem.
