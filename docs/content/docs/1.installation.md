## Setting up VSCode

If you're using VSCode, you can install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension to get autocompletion for the utility classes.

![Tailwind Intellisense](/img/content/docs/intellisense.png)

You can read more on how to set it up on the [tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense#recommended-vs-code-settings) github repository, but to summarize, you'll need to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

::code-group

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
  },
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": true
  }
}
```
