# Right-to-left (RTL)

Switching between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) is a common requirement for internationalization, like for languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian ...

## Overview

Shuriken UI use manual tailwind dark mode using `.dark` class selector, instead of default behavior from tailwindcss relying on `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

This allows you to have more control over the dark mode appearance and to be able to switch between light and dark mode easily.

## How it works

Shuriken UI components are designed to work with RTL out of the box. You can easily switch between LTR and RTL by changing the `dir` attribute on the root element of your application.

As Shuriken UI components are built on top of Reka UI, you can also use the `BaseProviders` in order to set Reka UI's `config` to `dir: 'rtl'`. This will make sure that all Reka UI components are RTL-aware.

  <BaseProviders
    :config="{ dir: 'rtl' }"
