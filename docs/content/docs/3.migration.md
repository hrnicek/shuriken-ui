# Migrating to v4
Learn how to migrate your project to Shuriken UI v4.

## Overview
Shuriken UI v4 introduces a new set of features and improvements. This guide will help you migrate your project to the latest version.

As we were making updates to the library, we noticed that the Tailwind CSS team was releasing the first alpha of its highly anticipated v4. We decided to align our release with Tailwind CSS v4 beta to take advantage of the new features and improvements, that are quite outstanding.

## Less JS, more CSS

With the current Tailwind v3 version, the `tailwind.config.js` file allows you to override Tailwind’s default design tokens. It’s a customization hub where you can add custom utility classes and themes, disable plugins, and more.

In Tailwind v4, you don’t need a `tailwind.config.js` file and `@tailwind` directives. You’ll only need to import tailwindcss into your main CSS file, and you’re good to go. We decided to follow the same approach in Shuriken UI v4 to integrate seamlessly with the new Tailwind CSS paradigm. Therefore, loading Tailwind CSS and Shuriken UI is now as easy as:

::code-group
  ```css [main.css]
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@shuriken-ui/tailwind';
  ```
::

## Dark mode
The dark mode is now also declared using your main CSS file. You can enable it by using the `@variant` directive and by adding the following line to your main CSS file:

::code-group
  ```css [main.css]
  @variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
  ```
::

## Theme directive
The theme directive is now also declared using your main CSS file. You can enable it by using the `@theme` directive in your main CSS file. The theme directive is used to define the fonts, the color palette, the animations and anything related to the styles of your application. You can define the colors of your theme using the `@theme` directive in your main CSS file:

::code-group{expandable}
  ```css [main.css]
  @theme {
    --font-sans: Inter, sans-serif;
    --font-monospace: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace;

    --color-primary-50: var(--color-purple-50);
    --color-primary-100: var(--color-purple-100);
    --color-primary-200: var(--color-purple-200);
    --color-primary-300: var(--color-purple-300);
    --color-primary-400: var(--color-purple-400);
    --color-primary-500: var(--color-purple-500);
    --color-primary-600: var(--color-purple-600);
    --color-primary-700: var(--color-purple-700);
    --color-primary-800: var(--color-purple-800);
    --color-primary-900: var(--color-purple-900);
    --color-primary-950: var(--color-purple-950);

    --animate-nui-placeload: nui-placeload 1s linear infinite forwards;

    @keyframes nui-placeload {
      0% {
        background-position: -468px 0;
      }
      100% {
        background-position: 468px 0;
      }
    }
  }
  ```
::

::info-block{icon='logos:tailwindcss-icon'}
With this new CSS variables approach, Tailwind v4 is able to infer color classes if your variables start with the `--color-*` prefix. If you create a `--color-custom` variable, Tailwind will automatically generate classes like `bg-custom` or `text-custom`.

## Breaking changes
All the improvements brought by the new version of Shuriken UI come with a cost. We had to make some breaking changes to the library to align with the new Tailwind CSS v4 beta, as well as rewrite most components from the ground using Reka UI. Here are the most important changes you need to be aware of.

### Nuxt module
We used to serve Shuriken UI as a Nuxt layer. However, for performance and usability reasons, we chose to serve shuriken UI as a standard Nuxt module. This means that you will have to install Shuriken UI as a Nuxt module in your project. You will also need to import your main CSS file in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

::code-group
  ```js [nuxt.config.ts]
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
      '@shuriken-ui/nuxt',
    ],
    css: ['~/assets/tailwind.css'],
  })
  ```
::

### Utility CSS
We completely removed all the CSS classes and files that were making the component styles inside `@shuriken-ui/tailwind`. We switched to pure Tailwind utility classes used in component templates, greatly improving performance, tree shaking, final bundle size and the overall developer experience.

Therefore, the `@shuriken-ui/tailwind` package has been cleaned to only keep global utilities such as `nui-focus`, `nui-mask`, `nui-slimscroll`, etc...

### Reka UI
We rewrote all the components using Reka UI, a new library that acts as the Vue port of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/){:target="_blank"}. Reka UI is a library that allows you to create UI components using their unstyled and accessible primitives.

These low level components are extremely well implemented and accessible by default. We used them as the foundation of the Shuriken UI component system. This means that all the components have been rewritten from scratch, and some of them have been removed or renamed.

### Props changes
We made some changes to the props of the components to make them more consistent and easier to use. We also removed some props that were not necessary anymore.

We worked to make styling options and props more consistent, and removed a lot of them, while giving you more control over the components.

- All the `color` props have been renamed to `variant`.
- Former `variant` props have been removed.
- All the `contrast` props have been removed.
- All the `shadow` props have been removed.
- All the `classes` props have been removed.

### Removed components
We removed some components that were not necessary anymore, or that were not used by the community. Here is the list of the removed components:

- `ButtonGroup`
- `ButtonIcon`
- `ButtonAction`
- `ButtonClose`
- `CheckboxAnimated`
- `FocusLoop`
- `HeadlessCheckbox`
- `HeadlessRadio`
- `TabSlider`
- `Listbox`
- `TreeSelect`

### Reworked components
At some point, all the components have been reworked to be more consistent and easier to use. However, there are some components that received significant changes, and now have a very different structure. Make sure to check how they work now:

- `Button`
- `Autocomplete`
- `Select`
- `InputNumber`
- `Input`
- `InputFile`
- `Textarea`
- `Progress`
- `ProgressCircle`
- `Tabs`
